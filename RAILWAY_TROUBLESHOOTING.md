# Railway.app Troubleshooting & Results

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Your Repository

### Issue 1: Build Fails - Missing Requirements

**Problem:**
```
❌ ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement...
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# In your local backend directory:
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Test locally first
pip freeze > requirements.txt    # Update if needed
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Update requirements.txt"
git push
```

### Issue 2: Application Won't Start

**Problem:**
```
❌ ImportError: No module named 'your_module'
```

**Solution - Check Your Procfile:**
```
# If your main file is 'main.py' instead of 'server.py':
web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

# If your FastAPI instance is named differently:
web: uvicorn server:application --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

### Issue 3: Database Connection Fails

**Problem:**
```
❌ Database connection failed: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
```

**Solution:**
1. Ensure MongoDB service is running in Railway
2. Check `MONGO_URL` environment variable
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for full provisioning
