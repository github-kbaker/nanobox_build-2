# üö® RAILWAY ROOT DIRECTORY NOT SET CORRECTLY

## Problem: Railway is building from repository root, not /backend

The build output shows Railway is looking at:
```
yarn.lock
backend/
frontend/  
test_result.md
...
```

This means Railway is NOT using the `/backend` root directory setting!

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIX: Set Root Directory Correctly

### Step 1: Go to Railway Service Settings
1. **Open Railway dashboard**
2. **Click on your service** (the one that's failing)
3. **Go to "Settings" tab**
4. **Find "Source" section**

### Step 2: Fix Root Directory
**Current (Wrong):** Railway is using repository root
**Should be:** `/backend`

**Set Root Directory to EXACTLY:**
```
/backend
```

**Critical Notes:**
- ‚ùå NOT: `backend`
- ‚ùå NOT: `/backend/`  
- ‚ùå NOT: `backend/`
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `/backend`

### Step 3: Save and Redeploy
1. **Click "Save"**
2. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
3. **Click "Deploy Latest Commit"** (manual redeploy)

## ‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE: Delete & Recreate Service

If root directory setting isn't working:

### Option A: Start Fresh
1. **Delete current Railway service**
2. **Create NEW service from GitHub**
3. **IMMEDIATELY set root directory to `/backend`**
4. **Deploy**

### Option B: Check Service Type
1. **Ensure you created a "Web Service"** not a "Database"
2. **Web Services** have root directory settings
3. **Database services** don't have this option

## üîç Expected Correct Build Output

After fixing root directory, Railway should see:
```
.env
.nixpacksignore
Dockerfile  
railway.json
requirements.txt
server.py
```

NOT the repository root files!

2. **Set Root Directory to `/backend`**
3. **Save settings**
